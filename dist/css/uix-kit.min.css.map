This is all done automatically and internally.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * Every definition will be added to a \"com.greensock\" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,\n\t\t\t * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,\n\t\t\t * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so\n\t\t\t * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything\n\t\t\t * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock\n\t\t\t * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could\n\t\t\t * sandbox the banner one like:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * <script>\n\t\t\t *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a \"gs\" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...). Use whatever alias you want as long as it's unique, \"gs\" or \"banner\" or whatever.\n\t\t\t * </script>\n\t\t\t * <script src=\"js/greensock/v1.7/TweenMax.js\"></script>\n\t\t\t * <script>\n\t\t\t *     window.GreenSockGlobals = window._gsQueue = window._gsDefine = null; //reset it back to null (along with the special _gsQueue variable) so that the next load of TweenMax affects the window and we can reference things directly like TweenLite.to(...)\n\t\t\t * </script>\n\t\t\t * <script src=\"js/greensock/v1.6/TweenMax.js\"></script>\n\t\t\t * <script>\n\t\t\t *     gs.TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.7\n\t\t\t *     TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.6\n\t\t\t * </script>\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {!string} ns The namespace of the class definition, leaving off \"com.greensock.\" as that's assumed. For example, \"TweenLite\" or \"plugins.CSSPlugin\" or \"easing.Back\".\n\t\t\t * @param {!Array.<string>} dependencies An array of dependencies (described as their namespaces minus \"com.greensock.\" prefix).
